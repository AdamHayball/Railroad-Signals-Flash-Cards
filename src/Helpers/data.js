            "NON-AUTOMATIC BLOCK, CLEAR: Proceed. NOTE: A train or engine that is delayed after passing this signal must approach next signal prepared to stop. This signal provides information only about the next signal, not conditions of or on the track.",
          option2:
            "NON-AUTOMATIC BLOCK, APPROACH: Approach next signal prepared to stop. Train or engine exceeding Medium Speed must at once reduce to that speed. This signal provides information only about the next signal, not conditions of or on the track.",
          option3:
            "RESTRICTING: Proceed at Restricted Speed. Restricted Speed must be observed until the leading end of the movement reaches the next signal. EXCEPTION: When the signal governs movement to non-signaled territory or to a track signaled for movement in the opposite direction only, Restricted Speed applies until the leading end of the movement is through any crossovers, turnouts, or controlled point/interlocking limits governed by that signal.",
